import PageHeader from "../../common/PageHeader";

export default function Settings() {
  return (
    <div>
      <PageHeader>Settings</PageHeader>
      <p>
        It's just settings page and it's not finished and I even dunno what i should add here. But I think 
        that with the passage of time I shall fill up this page with some stupid and not so stupid settings.
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}
